Minor Result Error Declarations in PAPER[1] and its Detailed Experimental Results
Authors: G. Wu and W. Kang.

Paper: 
[1] G. Wu and W. Kang, "Vision-based fingertip tracking utilizing curvature points clustering and hash model representation," IEEE Trans. Multimedia, vol. 19, no. 8, pp. 1730-1741, 2017.

Minor Result Error Declarations:
In [1], which published on Jul./18/2017, we found that when we submitted the proof, we have made a mistake in TABLE I. The accuracy rate of the proposed method in PAPER[1] in Fist on SCUT database for HGR1 should be 173/194=89.18%, instead of 91.05%. This is a minor mistake, because when we calculate the average success rate (703/899=78.2%), we used the right result (173) rather than other wrong results. 

It is important to note that this minor error would not affect the other results, especially would not affect the average success rate of our proposed algorithm. Anyhow, we are really sorry if this error causes confusion to anyone. Since this paper has been published today (2017/07/18), we cannot revise it anymore but we think it is necessary and better to declare online to let everybody who is interested in [1] knows this minor error.

Detailed Experimental Analyses can be found in the attached PDF.
